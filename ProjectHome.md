OAuth.net is a .net library which provides full [OAuth](http://oauth.net/) consumer and provider support. The library facilitates secure API authentication in a simple and standard method for desktop and web applications.

OAuth allows user to grant and deny one application access to the data stored in another application. It forms one of the foundation blocks of the data portability concept, which has the aim of allowing users to easily move their personal data around the web.
